The programs in this subdirectory are related to evaluating a 1d integral
of a product of functions F(x)=G1(x) * G2(x) in the range x=[0,1] using-- 

(1) exact result (see notes): exact.f
(2) quadrature methods: quad.f
(3) Monte Carlo with random sampling of x: mc1.f
	The error calculation in mc1.f cannot be trusted be the consecutive 
	x values are highly correlated. In mc1_bin.f the data is binned 
	to remove the correlations and the error on the average is obtained.
(4) Monte Carlo with importance sampling of x: mc2.f
	with proper evaluation of error : mc2_bin.f 
These programs use a file 'param.dat' which is included automatically upon
compilation, provided that file is in the same directry.

These programs can be compiled in one shot using the shell script 
'compile'  --
To use it do the following--
(a) % chmod u+x compile
(b) % compile

(The g77 compiler for linux operating system has been assumed; 
in case your compiler is different, edit the 'compile' file
and put in the appropriate compiler command).

The result of typing '(b)' will be the  generation of corresponding
executable files for all the programs in (1)--(4).
To run them just type the name of the executable file at the prompt.
The results will appear on the screen.

Plotting the functions
----------------------
By choosing a fine grid in the range x=[0,1] the functions are tabulated
for plotting purposes in files--
plot_g1 for function G1(x)
plot_g2 for function G2(x)
plot_int for function F(x)
